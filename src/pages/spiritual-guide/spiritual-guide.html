      H.E Tsem Rinpoche, a high reincarnated Lama from Gaden Shartse Monastery, is the founder and spiritual guide of the Kechara 
      organisation. Fulfilling his previous lives’ prayers, H.E. chose to take rebirth amongst difficult circumstances to be close to those 
      who would need him most. Meeting the challenges of exile, broken homes, abuse, and continuous, violent attempts at denying him his one 
      love – the Dharma – with unshakeable faith and persistence, Rinpoche has emerged as the radiantly inspiring spiritual teacher and 
      friend we know today.

    <p>
      Recognised as the reincarnation of the 72nd Abbot of Gaden Shartse, Gedun Nyedrak, His Eminence’s spiritual lineage actually begins as 
      one of the eight main disciples of Je Tsongkhapa, the founding saint of the Gelugpa school of Tibetan Buddhism.
    </p>

    <p>
      H.E. has studied under many esteemed Gurus, including H.H. Kyabje Zong Rinpoche, H.H. Kyabje Ling Rinpoche and H.E. Lati Rinpoche. 
      With a Mongolian-Tibetan heritage, a childhood in Taiwan &amp; America, and intensive study in Gaden Monastery, H.E. Tsem Rinpoche is 
      one of the rare, precious teachers with the unique teaching ability to bridge East and West.
    </p>

    <p>
      Sacrificing his personal longing for a life spent in meditational retreat, H.E. Tsem Rinpoche has been teaching in South East Asia 
      since 1992, fulfilling the wishes of his Gurus H.E. Lati Rinpoche and H.E. Kensur Jampa Yeshe Rinpoche. Great benefit has been 
      predicted for this region, including China, through his Dharma activities. Witnessing Rinpoche’s electrifying power of speech, his 
      immense knowledge and wisdom, and his enthusiastic compassionate involvement with his ever-growing number of students and friends, 
      this is not hard to believe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Never losing or diluting the profound essence of the Buddha’s timeless wisdom, H.E. Tsem Rinpoche has a wonderful gift of presenting 
      the ancient teachings in ways accessible and relevant to us inhabitants of the 21st century’s global village. Basing his Dharma 
      sessions on logic and shared human values renders his message universal, free of the limitations of dogma, culture and individual 
      background. Rinpoche’s brilliance of mind arouses our interest to explore with him the human condition in a deeper way, and his great 
      kindness, generosity and enthusiasm are contagious and awaken in many the wish to enter the sacred path of study, contemplation and 
      meditation.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the tradition of the great Mahasiddhas, Rinpoche helps and guides us by whatever means will be most beneficial, caring only about 
      our ultimate liberation. Refusing to make an artificial distinction between formal Dharma and everyday life, he is a master at turning 
      every situation into new, contemporary methods to transmit the essence of the teachings, and is recognised as a real-life Bodhisattva 
      by his teachers and students alike.
