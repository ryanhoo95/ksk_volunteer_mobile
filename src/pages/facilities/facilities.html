      Kechara Soup Kitchen’s activities rapidly outgrew our old premises in SunwayMas Commercial Centre, which is at least half an hour from 
      the areas in which we serve our clients.

      Wanting to reach out to our clients more effectively, we acquired our own permanent building just off Jalan Imbi. After two months of extensive renovation, we began operations from these premises on 6 September 2010. Located at the heart of Kuala Lumpur and in a very busy area, KSK’s new office is in a very convenient and safe location for both our clients and volunteers.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this building, we serve hot meals, water, fruit and bread to our clients every day of the week. We also have facilities to 
      provide medical treatment, job placements and laundry facilities. Most importantly, at our new building, we have the capacity to 
      interact with each of our clients directly through counseling.

      To help us help others with this new building, please contact our Project Director Justin Cheah (justin.cheah@kechara.com; +6010 333
