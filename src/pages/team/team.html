      Kechara Soup Kitchen (KSK) is led by a dedicated committee of people who are passionate about what they do. The KSK committee has 
      grown KSK’s services from a distribution of 20 food packets per week back in 2006, to more than 850 packets per week. In September 
      2010, this went one step further when KSK opened our permanent soup kitchen. Today, alongside our regular weekend distribution service,
       we also serve 180 people everyday, on Mondays to Fridays.
