      <p><b>GENERAL GUIDELINES FOR VOLUNTEERING</b></p>

      <p>I as a volunteer volunteering in Kechara's Soup Kitchen / Food Bank hereby agree to adhere to the following guidelines:</p> 
     
      <p>1. We encourage you to wear our Kechara / Corporate / Red tee (whichever applicable) shirt for your safety. It is easier for the homeless (or Food Bank beneficiaries) to identify you, easier for us to identify you in times of danger. Please always wear proper attire such as tee shirt, <b>LONG</b> jeans, sneakers <b>AND NOT</b> blouse, skirts or high heels.</p>

      <p>2. This is solely a charity event and all volunteers are <b>NOT</b> to discuss/promote sensitive issues relating to religion, politics and racial harmony.</p>

      <p>3. <b>REFRAIN</b> from taking photographs/videos directly of the homeless. If you need photos/videos for your CSR/Learning Institution assignments, please approach our coordinator and your request will be attended to. For Food Bank deliveries, please seek permission from the families before taking photos of them with the delivered supplies.</p>

      <p>4. For social media postings, we encourage you to blur out the homeless / food bank beneficiaries' faces to protect their identities and as a mark of respect to them. Otherwise photos should be taken from an angle where their faces will not be revealed.</p>

      <p>5. <b>DO NOT</b> give cash to the homeless or any of the food bank family beneficiaries, regardless of the circumstances.  If cash is required for any reason, the Team Leader or Coordinator will make the decision after consultation. </p>

      <p>6. Remember at all times that the homeless and our food bank families are human beings. They do not want pity but require inspiration to help them out in their current circumstances. Please always show them respect. Do not crowd round the homeless people and do not wander around in the house of our poor family / beneficiaries.</p>

      <p>7. Please do not react to them should some homeless clients (food bank families) who are not friendly. We should leave immediately and regroup in safe place should the situation gets out of control. For Food Bank families, we should not demand to get into their house should they not allow it.</p>

      <p>8. Always approach the homeless from the front and never from behind as this sometimes startles them.</p>

      <p>9. If a homeless person is asleep, do not wake them up to give food. Place the food packet next to them quietly from the correct standing position standing from the feet area position stated in the briefing and leave quietly. For any poor families who are not at home during delivery, you will keep it and resend another day or resend it back to our office in Imbi.</p>

      <p>10. Please keep noises and chatting to the minimum and beware of your surroundings at all times on the streets.</p>

      <p>11. <b>ALWAYS</b> follow and stay with the team. Listen carefully to all instructions and guidelines given by the Team Leaders.</p>

      <p>12. Do not wander off to other areas on your own, as some areas are dark and unsafe. For Food Bank activities, we do not encourage you delivering the provision supplies on your own. Always go with another partner / friend. For your own safety, please pay attention at all times and unnecessary use of smartphones during volunteering is <b>STRICTLY NOT ALLOWED</b>.</p>

      <p>13. Volunteers are not allowed to dispense or purchase any form of oral medication to both our homeless and food bank clients. Refrain from taking them to the hospital on your own especially a homeless client. Consult your Team Leader if you see someone who need medical attention especially people with communicable diseases such as Tuberculosis (TB), HIV and Hepatitis. For patients with TB, please maintain reasonable distance from them. Request for a mask if needed. Bring your own sanitiser and mosquito repellent sticker if you wish to.</p>

      <p>14. Please refrain from wearing any ostentatious items such as gold, jewellery, expensive watches to minimise the chances of you being robbed or accosted. Your belongings especially handbags are to be kept in a safe place (for example, well hidden in a car) during volunteering. Beware how you are keeping your belongings taking note that it should not be exposed and easily taken away.</p>

      <p>15. If questioned by any person other than a member of the volunteer group (i.e. member of the public, government official) about the activities please direct such queries to the Team Leader or the coordinator who is authorised to respond on behalf of the society.</p>

      <p>16. Keep in mind at all times that some of the homeless are unstable and unpredictable and may not want to be approached under any circumstances. Consult your Team Leader in such circumstances. <b>DO NOT</b> chase after them.</p>

      <p>17. <b>DO NOT TOUCH</b> anything belonging to the homeless / food bank families or around the area where they gather or live. Please be extra cautious whenever deliveries are made especially to slum areas. Some of our food bank beneficiaries are located in these areas and kindly be considerate when you park your vehicles so that it does not block any traffic.</p>

      <p>18. Please let our Coordinator or Team Leader in charge know if you have any long term sickness, or actually not feeling well before / during the course of volunteering which can endanger you and your teamâ€™s safety. In case you are pregnant, it is not advisable that you participate in our volunteering programme.</p>

      <p>19. If you are under 18, you must be accompanied by an adult either your parent(s) or guardian(s) joining you helping in the kitchen or food bank delivery. You are not eligible for volunteering in soup kitchen distribution on the streets if you are under 18.</p>
