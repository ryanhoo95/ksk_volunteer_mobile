      Kechara Soup Kitchen (KSK) was founded by <span class="Withdraw" (click)="toSpiritualGuide()">His Eminence Tsem Rinpoche</span>, the 
      Spiritual Guide of the Kechara organisation. As a young child, Tsem Rinpoche was often hungry and after years of physical and 
      emotional abuse, he ran away from home when he was 15 years old. He made a harrowing journey across the United States, from New Jersey 
      to Los Angeles.

      Since this experience, Rinpoche has always donated food to the poor and encouraged others to do the same. In 2006, a group of 
      Rinpoche’s students began to distribute food in the centre of Kuala Lumpur. Being mindful and respectful of others’ beliefs, KSK is 
      strictly non-religious and does not discriminate in terms of race or culture. For this reason, our food is always vegetarian.

      As this group grew under the motto of “Hunger Knows No Barriers”, we began to realise that we had to be more structured in order to be 
      more efficient. Therefore, a working core committee of volunteers was formed, to organise the allocation of volunteers for KSK’s 
      routes, the raising of sponsorship and packing of food, amongst other duties.

      On 11 August 2008, KSK had its first Annual General Meeting (AGM) as a registered society and a new committee was elected.
