      Kechara Soup Kitchen (KSK) is a non-religious community action group that distributes food, basic medical aid and counselling to the 
      homeless and urban poor of Malaysia.
    </p>

    <p>
      Founded by <span class="Withdraw" (click)="toSpiritualGuide()">His Eminence Tsem Rinpoche</span>, the Spiritual Guide of the Kechara 
      organisation, KSK is strictly non-religious, being mindful and respectful of others’ beliefs. We do not discriminate in terms of race, 
      gender or culture, our motto being “Hunger Knows No Barriers”. For this reason, our food is vegetarian.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kechara Soup Kitchen’s mission in the short term, to provide sustenance and basic medical care for the homeless and urban poor in 
      Malaysia.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the medium term, we aim to provide a permanent soup kitchen building as a place of safety, “off street”, for the distribution of 
      hot food and medical treatment facilities for the homeless, whilst continuing to provide street food delivery to those who are unable 
      to come to the centre.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the long term, Kechara Soup Kitchen’s mission is to reduce the flow of homeless living on the streets by providing a nurture centre 
      building as a place of training and assistance to help make the homeless employable and for them to re-enter society.
